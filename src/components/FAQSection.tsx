                    answer: "Unlike Salesforce's complex tiered pricing that can cost hundreds of dollars per user per month for full functionality, Xelytics offers a simple, all-inclusive price of $150/month for up to 20 users. This includes all features with no hidden costs or add-ons, making our solution typically 80-90% more cost-effective for small to medium businesses. Our customers save an average of $15,000 annually compared to equivalent Salesforce implementations. We also offer a 20% discount for annual subscriptions, bringing the effective monthly cost down to just $120."

We're particularly well-suited for growing businesses that want powerful tools but can't justify the cost of traditional enterprise CRM systems. Our typical customers include professional service firms, e-commerce businesses, manufacturing companies, and non-profits with 5-20 employees."

Most clients complete their initial setup within a day, and our step-by-step guided implementation process walks you through each stage. Of course, our support team is always available to help.

Our guided implementation process includes data migration, user setup, and customization of key elements like sales stages and custom fields.

These generous allocations are designed to accommodate the needs of growing businesses.

                    answer: "Yes. We provide a comprehensive RESTful API that allows for custom integrations with your existing systems. Our API documentation includes examples for common use cases, and our support team can assist with integration questions.

                    answer: "If you approach your allocation limits, Xelytics will notify you proactively. Additional resources can be added at competitive rates: $0.025/GB for additional file storage, $0.15/GB for additional database capacity, and $0.10/GB for additional bandwidth. We don't automatically charge for overages without your approval. Our flexible scaling approach means you only pay for the additional resources you need while maintaining the base plan's cost-effectiveness."
